# BayesianEstimator Class for sktime and skpro

## 1. Introduction

This proposal outlines the design for a new `BayesianEstimator` template class to be integrated into `sktime` and `skpro`. The class aims to provide a flexible and robust framework for Bayesian estimation, while ensuring compatibility with existing `sktime` and `skpro` interfaces.

## 2. Problem Statement

Bayesian estimators integrate prior knowledge through prior distributions and update this knowledge based on observed data to form posterior distributions. The proposed `BayesianEstimator` class will accommodate this unique workflow while offering methods for prior specification, model building, posterior inference, and visualization.

## 3. Key Elements
Here are the key elements are that every Bayesian model needs to support:
1. Specification of prior distributions
2. Retrieval and inspection of prior distributions
3. Model fitting (Bayesian inference)
4. Retrieval and inspection of posterior distributions
5. Prediction using the posterior distribution
6. Bayesian update of an already fitted model
7. Visualization and diagnostics

## 3.1. Specification of prior distributions
A key design decision we need to address is how users should specify prior distributions to be passed to the PyMC model context. Below are some possible strategies


| Strategy                                                       | Advantage                                    | Disadvantage                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 
Pre-define the prior distributions, only allow users to specify parameters (e.g., mu and sigma) | <ul><li>Simplifies user input</li><li>Doesn't have to think about how to represent priors as distributions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Limits flexibility</ul> |
| 
Using `skpro` distribution                                                 | <ul><li>Native to the `skpro` project</li><li>Ease of interface with `pandas`</li></ul> | <ul><li>Require convert to PyMC distribution within model stack</li> |
|
`bambi`                                                    | | <ul><li>Inflexibility</li><li>Unfamiliar API (using string to define the whole model) that might be incompatible with sklearn interface</li></ul> |
|
`Prior` class from `pymc-marketing`                                                    | <ul><li>Easy to use API</li><li>Compatibility with pymc</li><li>Comes with pre-defined Bayesian template class that we can refit to our template and repurpose as our Bayesian class going forward</li></ul>| |


## 3.7. Visualization and Diagnostics

Implement methods for:
1. Visualizing prior and posterior distributions
2. Trace plots for MCMC diagnostics
3. Prior vs Posterior plots
4. Posterior predictive check plots
5. Model flow visualization (similar to Graphviz visualizations of PyMC models)


## 4. Considerationss
### 4.0 General principles
1. Proliferation of methods should be avoided, all other things being equal.
2. Unified interfaces that are easy to comply with are better than those that are difficult to follow, and thatÂ´s better than non-unified

From this, some slight preferences:
- mapping priors on __init__, and posteriors on `get_fitted_params`
- unification: single prior param argument and `posterior_` fitted param
- that means, we need a `BaseObject` child class for priors/posteriors; this could be a `BaseDistribution` representing multiple, potentially associated random variables?

### 4.1 Model Specification
- Support defining Bayesian models, including specifying likelihood functions and linking them with priors.
- Design for modularity to support various Bayesian paradigms (e.g., Conjugate Bayesian analysis, MCMC, Variational Inference).

### 4.2 Inference Methods
- Implement methods for obtaining posterior distributions using MCMC (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs Sampling) or Variational Inference.
- Consider implementing different inference methods as strategy objects.

### 4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
- Implement methods for tuning hyperparameters of priors, possibly using cross-validation.

### 4.4 Extensibility
- Design the `BayesianEstimator` classes to be easily subclassed for specific Bayesian paradigms or custom models.
- Allow users to define custom models and priors that can be easily integrated into the framework.

### 4.5 Integration with skpro Distributions
- Consider how to integrate or interoperate with existing `skpro` distribution classes.
- Possibly implement conversion methods between `BaseDistribution` and skpro distributions.

### 4.6 Compatibility with sktime and skpro
- Design the class to be orthogonal to existing model classes in `sktime` and `skpro`.

## 5. Implementation

To aid discussion and illustrate points, a WIP implementation is provided by the `BayesianLinearRegressor` class, as introduced in the [PR](https://github.com/sktime/skpro/pull/358) for `skpro`.  i

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Using `PyMC` as backend:**  
   By using `PyMC`, this class leverages a popular and well-established ecosystem that supports a wide range of Bayesian modeling techniques.

2. **Consistent Data Handling with `ArViz`:**  
   The internal data container is managed by `ArViz`, a standard in the Bayesian analysis community. `ArViz` works seamlessly with `PyMC`, offering a consistent interface for handling and visualizing posterior distributions and other relevant data. This choice ensures that users can leverage the extensive visualization and diagnostic tools provided by `ArViz` without additional overhead.

3. **Flexible Prior Specification using `pymc-marketing`'s `Prior`:**  
   The class allows for the use of either default priors or custom priors via `pymc-marketing`'s `Prior` class. This makes it accessible to both beginners, who can rely on sensible defaults, and more advanced users, who can tailor the model to their specific needs. The `Prior` class integrates natively with the `PyMC` model stack, ensuring a smooth experience when defining custom priors.
   
   Note that `pymc-marketing`, the creator of the `Prior` class, is composed of the same team behind `PyMC`. This suggests that both the `Prior` class and the broader `pymc-marketing` library are likely to receive ongoing updates and support. The `Prior` class itself appears to be a wrapper around PyMC primitives, which we could replicate from scratch if needed.

The list of methods defined in this class are as follows:


| **Method**                                    | **Description**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fit(X, y)`                                   | Fits the Bayesian Linear Regression model to the training data `X` and target `y`.                   |
| `predict_proba(X)`                            | Predicts the probability distribution of the target variable for the input data `X`.                 |
| `visualize_model(**kwargs)`                   | Visualizes the Bayesian model using `graphviz`.                                                      |
| `sample_prior(return_type=None)`              | Samples from the prior distributions. Optionally returns the samples in the specified format.        |
| `get_prior_summary(**kwargs)`                 | Returns summary statistics of the prior distributions.                                               |
| `sample_posterior(return_type=None)`          | Samples from the posterior distributions. Optionally returns the samples in the specified format.    |
| `get_posterior_summary(**kwargs)`             | Returns summary statistics of the posterior distributions.                                           |
| `sample_in_sample_posterior_predictive()`     | Samples from the posterior predictive distribution using the in-sample data.                         |
| `plot_ppc(**kwargs)`                          | Plots the posterior predictive check using the sampled posterior predictive distribution.            |

Many of these methods act as a thin wrapper around `PyMC` and `ArViz`, abstracting away the complexity and reducing the need for users to be knowledgable of these underlying packages.
